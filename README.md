# 🔐 Ransomware_Project

This repository is a simulation-based project that demonstrates how file encryption and decryption mechanisms work, commonly seen in ransomware. It is meant for educational and research purposes only.

---

## 🔧 Requirements

- Python 3.x
- cryptography library (or any library used in the scripts)

Install dependencies (if any):

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
🚀 How to Use
🔒 Encrypt Files
Run the following command to encrypt a target directory or file:

bash
Copy
Edit
python encrpt.py
Customize the target directory or file path within the script as needed.

🔓 Decrypt Files
To decrypt previously encrypted files:

bash
Copy
Edit
python decrypt.py
Make sure the decryption key used matches the encryption key.

🧪 Additional Script
redundacy.py: Contains support code for redundancy, backup, or recovery functionality. Review it to understand auxiliary logic related to encryption safety or logging.

📌 Notes
Ensure you test the scripts in a safe and isolated environment.
Backup your data before testing file encryption or decryption.
